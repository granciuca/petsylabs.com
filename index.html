                <div class="what-is-pt1">

                    <div class="text">

                        <p class="par-1">Fish oil is one of the most widely used supplements 
                            for those looking to stay active for the long haul by supporting joint mobility, 
                            flexibility, and smooth movement.</p>

                        <p class="par-2">This is because fish oil contains omega-3s which fight off inflammation.</p>

                        <p class="par-3">The problem is though the omega-3s found in fish oil aren't the most potent. 
                            Few actually realize 73 miles off the pristine waters of the Antarctic coast you can find 
                            a specific type of super-nutrient known as Krill Oil that has been shown to be 8X more bioavailable in the human body.
                        </p>

                <div class="what-is-pt2">

                    <p class="par-1">You see, the omega-3s found in Krill Oil come in a specific layer called phospholipid. 
                        This type of layer is found in every cell in your body making it more absorbable and far more potent.</p>

                    <p class="par-2">The good news is NativePath Antarctic Krill Oil contains omega-3s like DHA and EPA that your body can‚Äôt produce on its own, 
                        as well as phospholipids and the powerful antioxidant astaxanthin ‚Äì which aren‚Äôt found in typical fish oil.</p>

                        <p class="par-1">Fish oil has traditionally been a popular source for omega-3s, but due to the emergence of heavy metals in our oceans, 
                            krill oil has significantly grown in popularity as a more pure and safer choice.</p>

                        <p class="par-2">What‚Äôs more, recent research has uncovered a few other key reasons why krill oil serves as a superior omega-3 source:</p>

                            <ul>

                                <li>No unpleasant taste: Unlike fish oil, there‚Äôs no fishy aftertaste will krill oil supplementation (goodbye embarrassing fish burps!)</li>

                                <li>Better absorption: The omega-3s in Krill oil are bound to phospholipids (instead of triglycerides) - 
                                    making it easier for the intestines to absorb for more rapid benefits</li>

                                <li>Age-defying antioxidant benefits: Krill oil also contains Astaxanthin, a potent antioxidant that helps fight age-related free radical damage</li>

                                <li>Unrivaled purity: Because krill are sourced from the pristine waters of Antarctica, there‚Äôs virtually no exposure to oceanic toxins - yielding the purest source of omega-3s available on the planet</li>

                        <p class="description">Antarctic Krill Oil is the 5th supplement 
                            I've bought in the last 8 months.
                             The other 4 were for other health issues 
                             and didn't work. So, I was a bit skeptical when 
                             I bought this product, but hopeful. I've been on 
                             it for only 5 weeks and the swelling in my legs, 
                             ankles, and feet is totally gone-completely cleared up.
                              Since I bought 3 bottles, I can only imagine how good I'
                              ll feel after 12 weeks. Even my thinking is clearer as well as my memory. 
                            This product is amazing. If you have the same swelling problem that I had, BUY THIS PRODUCT! You won't be sorry.

                        <p class="description">I was diagnosed with dry eye syndrome a
                            bout three years ago and the physician prescribed a very very 
                            pricey medicine to combat the burning and dryness of the eye. 
                            When I read about your Krill Oil I decided I would try it... 
                            I had nothing to lose but dry itchy burning sensation in my eyes. 
                            I have stopped taking the medication and I take one krill oil every evening before I go to bed and 
                            the dryness in my eyes has become a non-issue I no longer have a burning dry eye syndrome.

                            is the shaking going on when eating, especially soup.

                            the shaking with Krill Oil by holding my eating utensil very
